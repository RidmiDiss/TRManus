*   **Position Trading:** Long-term trading strategy where positions are held for weeks, months, or even years, focusing on major market trends.

## Market Analysis Techniques

Three primary types of market analysis are used in forex trading:

*   **Technical Analysis:** Studying historical price charts and patterns, indicators, and trading volumes to predict future price movements. This involves identifying trends, support and resistance levels, and chart formations.
*   **Fundamental Analysis:** Evaluating economic, social, and political factors that can influence currency prices. This includes analyzing economic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation, interest rates), central bank policies, and geopolitical events.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Assessing the overall market mood or feeling towards a particular currency or market. This involves understanding how market participants are positioned and their collective expectations, often influenced by news and social media.
